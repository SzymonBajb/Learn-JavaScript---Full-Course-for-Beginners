//The are 3 ways to set a variable in javascript
var myName = "Szymon"; //can be used in the entire program

let ourName = "freeCodeCamp" //can be used only in the scope

const pi =3.14 //can't ever be changed

myName = 8

var a; //you can skip semi-colon in java script if it is followed by a line break, but it's recommended for clarity

var b =2;
console.log(a)

a =7;

b=a

console.log(a)

var a = 9;
